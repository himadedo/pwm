Why does Hollywood have to make God look bad or weak or cruel and call such a movie an adaptation of bible(Remember Noah killing his new born grandchildren n saying God asked him to kill...outrageous)!! Why does the world think whitecasting is the biggest problem and not that every thing about the movie from Moses handing over the staff to his kid to scientific parting of the Red Sea without divine intervention...from Moses coming back and having a conversation with Ramesses with a sword to his neck to God not guiding Moses through to Red Sea..every such detail being a hideous lie and a complete diversion from the story in the bible!!! Cant you see why Hollywood is spending all the money to retell these stories..coz that's how they want ppl to remember them..!Ohhh forget the horrendous killing of the first child by pharoah..His very son calling ppl who believe in God lunatics! I will tell you why they are spending all the money in these ridiculous mentally enslaving movies...out of a crowd of 200 who watched the movie in the theatre with me..everyone except me came out thinking that 'People who believe in God of Moses are lunatics'! I think for a medium that can influence people so much, it's a big victory to divert the remaining non-christian audiences away from the one true God..who is kind, compassionate and forgiving(Remember Jesus)!
